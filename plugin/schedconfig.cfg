# Scheduling middleware configuration

# This file is needed to properly configure the scheduling middleware.
# Please do not edit if you don't know what you are doing.

# Available scheduling algorithms are

# EDF - Based on SCHED_DEAD, it is an earliest-deadline-first implementation
# built on a constant-bandwidth-server. Need period/deadline/wcet

# DM - Based on SCHED_FIFO, it is an implementation of deadline-monotonic.
# Need period/deadline/wcet

# RMSS - Based on SCHED_FIFO, it is an implementation of a sporadic server
# that can run also a period task. Need period/budget (wcet)

# FP - Based on SCHED_FIFO, it is simple fixed priority scheduling algorithm,
# need only a priority.

# RR - Based on SCHED_RR, it is the kernel SCHED_RR mirror. Need only a
# fixed priority.

# CUSTOM - Customized plugin.

# Note that importance can't be assigned in casual way, must follow the
# importance given by the kernel on each real sched algorithm. Also note that
# the importance value work in descendent way (0 is the most important, 5 the
# least important.
# Please refer to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sched.7.html
